git-transform-repo is provided under either the MIT License or GPL 2.0-only
(with linking exception), at your option.

The usage of the MIT license probably makes git-transform-repo compatible with
everything, but just in case, these files can also be used under whatever open
source license[1] that git-filter-repo, git, or libgit2 use now or in the
future. Currently, git-filter-repo uses MIT or the licenses of the other two[2],
git uses GPL 2.0-only[3], and libgit2 uses GPL 2.0-only (with linking exception)
[4].
